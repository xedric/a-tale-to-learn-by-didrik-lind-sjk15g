Once upon a time in the future year 2028(a leap year actually) a big event occured, lets call it a tale since we still can change our future
and this may be nonsense. By the way. . . I as the tale holder is from the future!!
 
Anyways, Mankind had just screwed up their planet Tellus and was forced to find a new planet within the time range of 2 weeks.
